# Neural Cityscape Viewer

**Neural Cityscape Viewer** is a creative app for visualizing and interacting with feedforward neural networks using metaphors from neuroscience. In this app, neurons are represented as cities and synapses as roads connecting them—turning complex neural structures into an engaging, accessible city map.

This project combines scientific accuracy with imaginative visualization. It’s designed to make neural networks easier to understand, whether you’re a student, educator, or just curious. Inspired by a passion for physics and simplifying complex concepts, this tool aims to bridge the gap between science and intuition.
